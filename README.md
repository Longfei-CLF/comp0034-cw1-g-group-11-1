# Introduction

Volcano eruption is a natural disaster that hard to predict. Without any forecast or contingency plan, volcano eruption might cause tremendous losses to society and humans. However, scientist can make a probability estimation with sufficient long-period eruption data set. (Turner et al., 2007) Thus, in the project, some dimensions such as the number of eruptions, the duration of the eruption and the volcano eruption index (VEI) are presented by visualizing the eruption data. This visualization design could help scientist to predict the possibility of volcano eruptions by using two sets of plot. The first section is a general overview of the volcanoes around the world. The second section is about more specific plot that used to predict the eruption.


# Overview of the volcanos around the world

For the location plot. We decide to highlight all volcanoes on a world map. Our target audience is geologist who wants to analysis the characteristics of the volcano. 

For instance, most volcano located in the seismic belt. Geologist could use our volcano map to see the exact location of volcano and its surrounding area. This information could help them to speculate the formation of the volcano. For instance, If the volcano is nearby a joint between continent, it might be formed by plate movement. Moreover when we put all the volcanoes in the same map, it is easy to see the distribution of the volcano. Some area have a high density of volcano and some area rarely have a volcano. Geologist could investigate the characteristics of these areas.  The data needed for this visualization is the longitude and latitude of the volcano which is already prepared the original dataset.
