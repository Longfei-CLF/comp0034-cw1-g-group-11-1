Plot 1: Location of valances around the world

For the location plot. We decide to highlight all volcanoes on a world map. Our target
audience is geologist who wants to analysis the characteristics of the volcano. For
instance, most volcano located in the seismic belt. Geologist could use our volcano map to see the exact location of volcano and its surrounding area. This information could help them to speculate the formation of the volcano. For instance, If the volcano is nearby a joint between continent, it might be formed by plate movement. Moreover when we put all the volcanoes in the same map, it is easy to see the distribution of the volcano. Some area have a high density of volcano and some area rarely have a volcano. Geologist could investigate the characteristics of these areas.  The data needed for this visualization is the longitude and latitude of the volcano which is already prepared the original dataset.  

Explain your design for each visualisation: 


Plot 2 : VEI (Volcano Eruption Index) & Frequency 

The target audience could be the volcanologist or geologist who was investigating the scale and frequency of the volcano eruption. Since VEI is a terminology that widely used in the volcano studies, this plot will be used for academic research. If  volcanoes erupted frequently in a period, scientist should pay more attention since it might cause great damage to the neighboring cities. This visualization design will be made into a scattered-dot plot which the size of the dot is corresponding to the VEI. Moreover, x-axis is the Eruption time and y-axis is the number of eruption. Thus, this design can help scientist to identify the eruption scale in a specific period, easily from the dot size and its position on the graph. The data needed is VEI and a sum of all eruptions at each year. In order to obtain the data, we need to write a program that count the eruption numbers for a fixed year.
