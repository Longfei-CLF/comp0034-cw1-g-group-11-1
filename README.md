# Introduction

Volcano eruption is a natural disaster that hard to predict. Without any forecast or contingency plan, volcano eruption might cause tremendous losses to society and humans. However, scientist can make a probability estimation with sufficient long-period eruption data set. (Turner et al., 2007) Thus, in the project, some dimensions such as the number of eruptions, the duration of the eruption and the volcano eruption index (VEI) are presented by visualizing the eruption data. This visualization design could help scientist to predict the possibility of volcano eruptions by using two sets of plot. The first section is a general overview of the volcanoes around the world. The second section is about more specific plot that used to predict the eruption.


# Overview of the volcanos around the world

In Fig.1, all volcanoes were highlighted on a world map. Since this is only a general graph, our target audience includes a wide range of people such as geologists, volcano enthusiasts, and local government. Moreover, this graphic design was intended to answers general information about volcanoes such as the total number of eruptions, average Eruption Duration, and VEI. They could play around with this graph to see the distribution of volcanoes. Also, the audience could use select boxes to filter the countries and volcanoes they want to look into. In order to position the volcano, we need longitude and latitude from the dataset and the corresponding volcano name on that coordinate. 

This design can be understood by the majority of people without expert knowledge which is appropriate for a wide range of audiences. Using the small blue spot to represent the volcano makes the audience easy to see and select them by moving the cursor.
